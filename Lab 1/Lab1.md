In this we can see the evaluation results and they mean the following:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of absolute errors. An error is the difference between the predicted value and the actual value.
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the average of squared errors of predictions made on the test dataset.
- Relative Absolute Error: The average of absolute errors relative to the absolute difference between actual values and the average of all actual values.
- Relative Squared Error: The average of squared errors relative to the squared difference between the actual values and the average of all actual values.
- Coefficient of Determination: Also known as the R squared value, this statistical metric indicates how well a model fits the data.
